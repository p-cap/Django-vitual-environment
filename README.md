# Django-vitual-environment with Python3
Created a bash script that automates the creation of a python virtual environment and Django project creation

## How to use
- clone this repo => ```git clone https://github.com/p-cap/Django-vitual-environment.git```
- change the permissions on both:
  ```chmod 700 virtual_env```
  ```chmod 700 start_django```
- Run ```./virtual_env``` first then....follow the prompt  
     NOTE: Make sure to pay attention to the logs displayed while running the script
- Copy paste the command indicated after running the ```./virtual_env```
- Then, run ```start_django``` and also, follow the prompt   
     NOTE: You'll be asked to provide a Django Project name and that is different from the virtual environment project name
     
                                           Happy Django Coding!!!
